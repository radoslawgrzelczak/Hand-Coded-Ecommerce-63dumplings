# My biggest Ecommerce Misunterstanding

Hey brotha!

This is repository of my completely hard hand-coded "ecommerce" website 

When I was 15 years old I was big in writing HTML and CSS code.

I wrote a dozens of simple blogs and bussiness cards for school students which want help in their IT lessons and homeworks

One time I got an order to code League of Legends Account Shop for 30$ - then for me it was outstanding amount of money :D

I have sitted to my desk computer and I was thinking "how can I sell these accounts on website". 

As a young kid I found a the most simple and most dumb (from my actual perspective) way to do that.

Create a button with a link, and after user click it, there was a redirect to Shoppy.gg with a complete offer.

Unfortunutely my customer was angry from my solution and wants a refund.

I gave up with coding for while

In 2020 when Covid-19 starts I was stuck at home.

Often I was alone cus my parents was at work and I had online education

I was watching a lot of Youtube Videos about cooking. 

As I hungry on the stomach (and the soul) guy I have tried to cook Polish Dumplings.

Quickly I have mastered folding, filling the dough with delicious meat and cheese combinations.

And someday I Thought: "Man, we should monetize that shit"

I can make dumplings and I can make websites!

I bind these two things.

Without any website-builders like Wordpress, Wix or Shopify.

And I have created my first "ecommerce" dumplings shop website in clean hand-coded way.

And the begging it was hosted on Heroku with working Stripe Payment Gateway.

But unfortunately after 30 days site crashed because I have had to pay after ending free trial.

After that accident (still as 16 years old guy) I got disappointed and gave up the 63dumplings project.

Here how it looks like - only from frontend part, the backend does not work but you can find everything in this repository and served on the free webhosting service

Enjoy my work brotha!
